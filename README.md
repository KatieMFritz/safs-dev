## Local (Dev) Environment

## Requirements

- PHP 7+
- Composer
- MySQL
- way to serve PHP locally*
- Node
- NPM

*On Windows, I recommend the latest edition of WampServer or WampServer 64. It includes PHP and MySQL and makes it easy to serve Craft 3 locally. You may need to do a little troubleshooting to get it to run on Windows 10.

Make sure you have the latest versions of these tools for best results.

### Installing

```sh
git clone ...
```

```sh
composer install
```

```sh
npm install
```
